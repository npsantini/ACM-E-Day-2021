# TinkerCAD Circuits Workshop - E-Day 2021
Welcome to E-Day everybody! This is the E-Day workshop that is hosted by the Association for Computing Machinery student chapter at the University of Kentucky. In this workshop we will be creating circuits that will involve code/code blocks. It is recommended for the 3rd grade level or above. In the workshop you will learn how to create awesome projects that use Arduinos, sensors, and all sorts of exciting things.

__The best part is there is no equipment needed!__

## What you will need
Like we said before, there is no equipment necessary to particpate in the workshops. These are the only things that you will need to participate in this E-Day activity:
* Internet connection
* A [Tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/) account

### How to participate in the workshop
If you are able to join us on E-Day during our live presentation, great! If not there is a video that will go over each of the projects we came up with for E-Day. There are also folders that have more information on each of the different projects we created. Those folders can be viewed above. In those folders we include links to the Tinkercad projects, code, and screenshots to help you out when creating these projects.
