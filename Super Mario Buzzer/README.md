# Arduino Super Mario Buzzer Project - Difficulty Level: Beginner

Use an arduino uno, piezo buzzer, and LED light to create a song with a light flash at every note. We will hook up the piezo and LED to the Arduino using a breadboard.
We then code the buzzer to play the classic Super Mario Songs. Enjoy a quick project with little difficulty.

### The Code:
The code can be found in the file above called **Super-Mario-Buzzer-Code.cpp**. We copy and paste this code during our project, and add some of our own code as well.
Here is a link to the code if you can not find it: [https://github.com/npsantini/ACM-E-Day-2021/blob/main/Super%20Mario%20Buzzer/Super-Mario-Buzzer-Code.cpp](https://github.com/npsantini/ACM-E-Day-2021/blob/main/Super%20Mario%20Buzzer/Super-Mario-Buzzer-Code.cpp)
